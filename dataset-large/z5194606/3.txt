message: i know you go to COFA, but every week i look forward to your 2pm tutes at the kensington campus. i'm not a stalker i swear, i've just seen you looking for a park around that time in your cute silver golf most tuesdays. i think your name is eliza, and i heard you have a twin brother? i really hope you're single, i'd love to buy you a drink. p.s. your smile is the only thing that stands out more than your lime green back pack
