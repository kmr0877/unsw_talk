message: To my mate who I used to tutor for MDIA. I've graduated now but I just want to say that I like you too. All of my friends have told me that you like me a lot and everything and I kind of regret not opening the way for you cause I was in love with another man. Now I realize that you would've been so much better for me. We're miles apart now, but if you ever feel like you want to give us a try, come to the famous Island of Indonesia and I'll be waiting for you
