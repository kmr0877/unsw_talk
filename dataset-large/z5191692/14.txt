message: No Pain, No Gain\n\nI tried my best\nTo make you see me\nTook an interest in you\nTreated you dearly\n\nBut in the end\nWas it all in vain\nBecause all I feel\nIs a world of pain\n\nLooked back on the past year\nAll the things we did\nScared I had overthought them\nRegretting the feelings I hid\n\nIt's been a year since I met you\nAn emotional rollercoaster, a wild ride\nHoped we might be closer now\nBut we're not, I feel like I've died\n\nYou were busy for most of this year\nI liked the way you worked with all your heart\nSo much that I turned my life around\nEven though it felt like it was already falling apart\n\nSo despite this distance that's forming\nYou message me less and less\nI don't care, I've had fun\nYou helped reduce my stress\n\nI'm still not perfect\nI'm still anxious and shy\nBut thanks to you\nI'm not afraid to try\n\nWe might become a couple\nWe might never talk again\nBut regardless, I want you to know\nI'm ok, you've been a great friend\n\nL.H. 6/9/15 #ruok?
