message: Aaron Leung, we are going to miss you so much!\nAlways swapping our food for your 'Pie Face' Pies at lunch. \nNow we all want a 'Pretty Lights' doofing shirt like you, \nOne penny and GoPro - Put those on the list too. \nYou used to love you're Big Macs - Before when they were free. \nSince then you've downloaded 'Snack in the Face' and been to KFC regularly. \nAnd yes, playing this game has become apart of our daily routine,\nWe honestly drop everything we're doing cos we're sadly that keen. \nIt's rare to spend a day with you and not laugh at all,\nYou're snapchats, and more and more snapchats are never a bore. \nYou love your EJ's with you're favourite tasty garlic sauce,\nTo you, it's even more important than studying for you're statistics course. \nSo in conclusion, we just want to say,\nYou've left us all with so many great memories at the end of the day. \nWe wish you all the best when you start your grad job next year,\nAnd just remember you really are that amazing, so you have nothing to fear :)
