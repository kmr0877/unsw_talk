message: I'm so glad that I found my Genie in a bottle. You know who you are. Just shouting you out, ET, for our 181 day anniversary – also known as 72% of nine months! Who knows if we get that far – my parents have high expectations of course! All I know is, you're aesthetic, I've got smarts … thems would be fine babies. Anyway, see you around Law, baby – because we do Law! Love, NM.
