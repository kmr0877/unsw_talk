message: Saw this girl at the Paksoc kebab event thing and she had long brown hair tied up in a ponytail. She was also wearing these glasses that looked so cute on her face. In general, she was so cute, short and pretty but she was standing next to this tall guy in a blue shirt (hopefully not your bf). Then I realised I'd seen her somewhere and it dawned on me she's the chick who promotes Bangladeshi society on love letters. Please invite me to all your Bangladeshi society events because I want to see your beautiful face! ❤️
