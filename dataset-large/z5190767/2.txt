message: Tim, I like you a lot. I like that no matter what your hairstyle is, you're still handsome. I like how easily your skin turns red when you rub it. I like how you carry pastel clothes I like how bored you are on lectures and can still understand it. I love your cuteness to prettiness spectrum. I love how childish you act sometimes. I love how you draw stuff on your hands or on your thighs. I love how you remember my name even though I look ordinary. I love seeing you. I hope you will find real happiness.
