message: Dear Law Society Vice President for Activities, Ben I first saw you when your bus picked us up from the middle of the F3. You were no doubt the biggest distraction at Law Camp! You also have the greatest taste in music <3 I nearly cried when someone told me first years weren't allowed to get with camp leaders...
