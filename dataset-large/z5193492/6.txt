message: Dear you #4,\n\nHow is it that you still hold so much power over my emotions? You alone create the most extreme feelings in me, make me feel things so much more strongly than anything else can. The most angry, the most sad, the most happy, the most peaceful, the most comfortable and all this in the space of just one day. It is unhealthy. \n\nHow can anyone or anything else ever compare to you when seeing you is like seeing the vivid, dynamic sunrise and but when you leave me, so like a sunset with its echoes of the light and colour of the day streaks across the sky - bitter with your leaving and sweet with your memory. How can there be another sun? \n\nAll else is a dark, sleepless night; the kind of night where everything is a haze, where you can just barely make out shapes in dark, but can discern no colour, the kind of night where the only thing I can do is to wait for the sun to come back to me. But still the earth goes around the sun, suffers through the night for the chance to see the sun rise again and knows that, despite the attraction, you will never be with the sun (for it would be your destruction). Round and round I go from day to night to day. I am forced to keep my distance but kept from leaving; from time immemorial until we have both reached the end of the universe.\n\n What kind of ridiculous strength would it require for me to break free from my constant orbit around you?
