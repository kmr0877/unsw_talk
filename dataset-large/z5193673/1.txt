message: To Kiran, Your funny, smart, tall, and handsome. What more could a girl want? We talk every now and again, but I feel as if you would never like me in the way I like you. I hear rumours that you have a girlfriend... Please comment here and tell me that is not true. I hope one day you'll realise who this is, and you'll see me the way I see you.
