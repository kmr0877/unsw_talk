message: I was taking this Psych SONA experiment for 1B a month ago (or more?) about improving memory involving blue dots (or was it ping sounds?). Anyway after the experiment, we had a chat going down the elevator in Matthews building and I do know this:\n-Your name is Amanda\n-You also took the same experiment but in a different room\n-You're taking Psych for your degree\n-Also taking 1B this sem, but don't go to lectures\n-Live in the Village\n-Our convo ended when you had to withdraw money from Commonwealth Bank\n\nNothing serious, just wanted to get to know you/add you on FB before term ends haha\n                                                                                                                                          - Guy in glasses and Bape hoodie that day\n\nP.S. I'm glad the experiment worked since I remember all this, hope you remember too! :D
