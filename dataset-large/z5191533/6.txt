message: Dear Henry, from the moment I saw your tall fine self walk into the room I knew you were the one. I love your sense of humour, though dark, your sense in music & your ability to self critique. I think this makes you a stronger, more comfortable person. \n\nEven though another girl, well two including the married one, tried to test my love for you, it burns bright like a flame. I think a date would be proper. \n\nI'll be watching you perform fantastically at Law Revue with such palatable eagerness. \n\nLove - Nadz
