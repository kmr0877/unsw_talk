message: Im a first year Asian commerce girl and I was wondering if anyone knows a guy called Kevin in my ACCT1501 tutorial. He is from a well do to Sri Lankan family and I have a thing for successful sub-continental fellows. I think he plays cricket as I always see him in his representative tracksuit pants, so stop Batting already and try and Pull me so we can Hook up.
