message: Dear Clarice,\nYou are the embodiment of my dream girl, right down to what I thought was the impossible hot gamer girl. I will not stand down from my dream just because Aaron met you first. I want to be why you smile. I wrote you a poem.\n\nWith breath inhaled sharply,\nI caught my first sights,\nOf a face filled with joy,\nA smile that delights.\nMy very first thought,\nAfter a moment spent shocked,\nWas "I must know this girl,\nMy heart she has rocked".\nUpon greeting the beauty,\nMy bewilderment grew,\nNot only was she gorgeous,\nBut a true sweetheart too.\nFrom there we began talking,\nOur conversation ran free,\nIntelligent and adorable,\nHow could no one else see?\nYet under the sweetness,\nA mind that knows fun,\nA cheeky quick wit,\nMy heart she has won\nWith curves that amaze,\nAnd a body to die for,\nThis fit young lady,\nHas me wanting her more.\nThe thought of her legs,\nAnd the curve of her hips,\nMy heart starts to race,\nI crave for her lips.\nThere isnt one thing\nAbout this girl called Clarice\nThat I do not love\nHaving her is the ultimate bliss\nIn closing I must say,\nYou are all I want to protect\nAnd wake up to everyday\nHow can one be so perfect?
