message: To the half-asian (i think) who got onto the M50 from lower campus on Monday, you are honestly the cutest girl ive seen on campus. You were wearing a long sleeve blue jumper and playing with your galaxy s4, i really do wish i said something to you :( either way youre amazingly beautiful and you should know that :)
