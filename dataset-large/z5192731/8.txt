message: To the first year boy on the 6:40 western line train from Central wearing a black hoodie, jeans and a grey bag studying Chemistry on carriage number 5327, I hope your name is avogadro because then I would already know your number. \n\nFrom the moment I saw you I was completely enthralled. I'm not sure whether you noticed that you had chalk on your chin but the way it mixed with your stubble was so attractive and turned me on. Your dedication for chemistry, in specific 'Intemolecular Forces' took my breath away and baby, I know my chemistry and you've got one significant figure. People say that the weakest intermolecular force is the dispersion force but I felt that even that was strong between us.\n\nI was so devastated when you were getting off the train so soon and so decided to go find myself a seat in the almost empty carriage. However, I could feel a strong attraction coming from the other side of the carriage and to my surprise and joy, I saw you once again with that dedication I adore. Although, I am a bit worried that you moved because you got scared of me reading over your shoulder. But you must admit when we made eye contact in the reflection of the train doors, there was certainly some chemistry between us and I know for a fact we would have been great lab partners. \n\nI feel like the most perfect date would not be something traditional as you seem like someone who loves some surprise so maybe we could have a nerf gun war and the loser cooks dinner?\n\nMay the odds be ever in your favour xoxo - K
