message: On Monday 2/5, I was catching the 39 something and as I was getting off, the rips in my denim shorts got caught in the zipper of this chicks bag. The bus driver was getting impatient, I was holding everyone up but you, Superman were there to save the day. With one strong tug, you freed me from extended humiliation and an extra trip on my opal card. Can I be your Lois Lane?
