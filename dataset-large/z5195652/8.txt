message: To the Indian guy I always see in the CEIC4000 lectures, I think I heard your friends calling you Ishandeep?\n\nI still remember the first time you walked down the aisle past me, those finely chiselled pectorals and a jawline Bollywood stars can only dream of. Every time I see you smile it sends shivers of pure ecstasy down my spine. On multiple occasions I have had to excuse myself from the lecture, becoming a moist mess. \n\nYou’re super cute and I can honestly tell from your fine physique that you spend a lot of time at the gym. \n\nI am too shy to approach you and I’m still a virgin, but I know that if we could get together it would be a happy ending. I truly am so hard for Sohal. \n\nCoffee sometime?
