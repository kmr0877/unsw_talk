message: Not really a love letter but am i the only one whos thinks that all the cute guys in law and commerce are all massive fuccbois who live dirty rave lifestyles?  You know those ones that make you feel special until you find out that youre just one of the 5 or 6 girls they talk to everyday??? Feels when you think youve finally found bae only to find out the only number higher than the amount of hoes he has is the amount of pills he pops.
