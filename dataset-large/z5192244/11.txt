message: Dearest Harrold, \n\nMy love for you blossoms like a prehistoric flower of mammoth proportions. You make me yell like a caveman for your name. I need you like a neanderthal needs fire. Your 21st birthday approaches and my love for you is timeless from prehistoric times to 1975 to now. \n\nLove, \nYour Prehistoric Princess <3
