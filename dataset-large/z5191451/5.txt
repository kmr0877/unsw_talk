message: To all my lovely uni friends ; i would like to thank you for allowing me the opportunity for me to be in your lives. I want you guys to know that without your support and guidance I wouldn't have mustered the courage to seek out new things. Being a first year is hard, and by having your company and support through solidarity through stressful times made uni life a lot more bearable. And although I may not play a significant impact in your lives you played a major role in mine so from the bottom of my heart I'd like to thank you all ❤❤❤ because without you guys who knows who'd i would become once uni had started in February.\n(Ps tag your friends you feel this love for because it's cool to give them a shout out - not all love letters need a romantic context )
