message: I think your name is David Sun/Sung/Song? from my 3rd year finance tute (fins3616 - Korean lookin' boi)\n\nWe first met on that night where I dropped my purse on the glittering floor of the UNSW walk way. At first, I didn't really think much of it but as my purse hit the ground and I looked up, I saw you standing there with surprised and keen eyes.\n\nBefore I bent over to pick up my purse, your strong hands objected. It was too late, the touch of your hands jilted across my body and i started to excrete fluids down there. What felt like an eternity only lasted a few seconds. Before I knew it, my purse was in my hands and you were gone. \n\nYou were too fast, the smell of a cigarette lingering behind from where you were.  I didn't even get a chance to say thank you or look into your beady eyes but I know one day that we will be reunited. \n\nTo David Sun/Sung/Song, wherever you may be, please keep on doing what you do.\n\nFrom Ma'm Cheddar, a cheesy girl that wants to look into your beady eyes again.\n\n(I'm wearing red panties next time I see you in my tute)
