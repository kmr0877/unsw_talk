message: To my Tinder Prince\nWhen we met you took my breath away,\nYou make me laugh hysterically;\nWith your green eyes, muscles and dark hair,\nAll I could do was stare.\n1 year on,\nI'm proud to say you're the one,\nAnd I can't wait to see what we become.\nYou have my love forever,\nYour Tinderella
