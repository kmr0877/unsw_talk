message: Is her name lisa l0l? \n\nBut if you want my honest advice, if you've gotten as close as you said you did I think you should just take the chance and ask her out. Think of it this way - If she's waiting for you to ask her out, it's not a friendship anymore and you won't be ruining anything, you'll be confirming something. If she thinks of you as only a friend now, but then could catch feels if she realises that you like her, that's a plus too. If she rejects you, you can either try continue being friends with her or part ways. But would you really prefer it if she gets a boyfriend when you could have had a chance and starts telling you about all the coupley stuff she does? Wouldn't you just distance yourself from her afterwards? That's not fair. \n\nRight now your relationship isn't platonic friendship anymore, it's her one sided friendship (maybe) and your one sided romantic feelings (maybe). Arguably, just by liking you 'ruined' your friendship so why are you scared? If it goes well great, if it doesn't go well then you didn't ruin anything anyway. \n\nActually just go study for exams wtf
