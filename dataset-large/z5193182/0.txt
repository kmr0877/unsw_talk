message: To the girl who slipped out of the shadows and into the library today bearing a batman shirt. You stole my heart like catwoman, had me nervous like the scarecrow and left me smiling like the joker. I knew why I fell but I didn't learn if I could pick you up. Light the signal and batman might come.
