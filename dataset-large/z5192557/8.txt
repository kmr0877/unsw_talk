message: To the Asian girl I "met" at the stairs on the outdoor area of roundhouse last April.\n\nIt was a Wednesday, me and my friends were getting a couple of drinks in the roundhouse during happy hour. Then one of my friends decided to go up to the 2nd floor because he thought there was a party. I followed him up there, but upon entering we soon realized it was an event by Hillsong on campus. We quickly went out, and upon exiting, there you were heading up the stairs. We locked eye contact, I smiled at you and you smiled back. You walked pass, but before you went in you looked back and said/pointed at something (I couldn't remember) but my friend pulled me away.\n\nI can still vaguely remember your face, you looked adorable and if ever I do see you again, I'll make sure to come up and say hi.
