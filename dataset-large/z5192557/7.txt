message: (Wednesday 25 May 2pm) - To the girl I walked by whilst i was mid-yawn, on the stairs going up to the quad with a stud in her hose and like light freckles walking with her friend. Sorry for a shit introduction but I definitely know we locked eyes. Let me know if you see this because i definitely want to see yours again!
