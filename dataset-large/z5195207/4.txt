message: To Stephen,\n\nYour jawline cuts through the still courtyard, your gentle smile through any awkwardness as you stroll across towards me. I’m engrossed by your dyed hair wavering in the gentle breeze, like golden leaves rustled by the autumn wind. And yet as you glance at me, I can only turn away as my heart slows briefly but when you turn towards another girl, a sadness spirals my heart back into a deep abyss. \n \nPerhaps it was never meant to be. But perhaps you really think there’s something better out there so you miss the best things in front of you. I just wanted to say it was love at first sight, at last sight, at ever and ever sight.\n\n:/
