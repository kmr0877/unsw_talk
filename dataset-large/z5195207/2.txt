message: On my second Oktoberfest, I met some munted girl who convinced me she’d have a better chance of getting into the bar if I pretended to be her boyfriend. That was the day we met and that girl has been my girlfriend for a year now. When I heard that this year’s Oktoberfest was cancelled, I got together with some mates and we decided to have our own. We planned to have a few beers on the grass. Nek minit we’ve got half of Darling Harbour booked out and three boats lined up. Want to find your future girlfriend? Even if it’s just for one night ;) z5195265
