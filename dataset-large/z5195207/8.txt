message: They say the eyes are the window to the soul, and that's exactly the case here. Your beautiful brown eyes captivated me as you walked past me in the library, and I wanted to know you from that moment. I swear everything around us slowed down  for those few seconds. My breath caught, my head swooned, and we both knew that this was something more than a passing attraction. You smiled at me just before your friend called out to you from behind. As you turned around, the way you flicked your long (dyed) blonde hair was something out of a movie. Your tanned and toned legs had me salivating at the urge to kiss my way all over your body. I hope we pass again, because I know this could be something special.
