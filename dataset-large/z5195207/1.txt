message: To the blonde girl that walked into the uni gym at around 4pm today, tuesday, wearing tight yoga pants and had her hair tied up, you are the most beautiful human being I have ever seen.\n\nI was at the sofa by the entrance getting ready to leave when you walked in and we held gaze for a couple of seconds before you went in for your workout, your beauty literally froze me in place. What is your name and are you single? I will go to the gym everyday at 4pm from this point on in hopes of running into you again.
