message: We've met at least once every semester but recently we've been seeing each other more. During my 4 hours break on Monday's I go up to the library to see you already there, lovingly lying down. I slowly walk up to you trying to get to you before some other friend of yours. When I'm with you I can tell that others envy me. To be with such a wonderful thing such as yourself is amazing. I hope to see you more but it seems that it will soon change. No longer will you be in the library. So before you leave, know this: I will always remember the wonderful times we've had together old library beanbags. It will never feel the same with the new beanbags.
