message: (Female) I am obsessed with a guy I train with but I feel like he doesn't notice me. The times we talk I feel like he's flirting with me, but I don't know if that's because he likes me or he does that with all girls. \nI really don't know much about him but I really really like him. How do I get him to notice me ? \n\nPlease send help!
