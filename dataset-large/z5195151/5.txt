message: What is Love?\nHow does it feel?\n\nI'm having trouble distinguishing between really liking someone as a good friend and loving that person. Being innately protective of those who I care about, that feeling provides little insight. Being a horny guy, who could really f**k anyone beyond a certain threshold of attractiveness, I can't distinguish on that front either. \n\nIt is just not enough that you enjoy a person's company a lot that you 'love' them.. Idk. Confused.\n\nAny insights?
