message: To the cute, small girl who showed me where the biomed building was, You are the sweetest person I have ever met. Anyone else would have pointed me in the direction but you spared your time for me and accompanied me to the top of campus to ensure I didn't get lost. Talking to you has lifted my moods to today. Your warm smile is unforgettable and all I can think about is you reaching up with your tiny "everyday is sunny" yellow umbrella to try keep my 6'2" dry, looking up with big eyes. Your head barely reached my shoulder! It broke my heart when you mentioned you had a boyfriend. I hope he treats you as well as I would, because I'd do anything for that smile and friendly cheer. I hope we cross paths again. Thanking you again, Claris (I disagree, I really like your name)
