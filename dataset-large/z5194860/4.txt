message: My friend,\n\ni'm sorry that i've hurt you and for what you're going through. I hope that things will be back to normal soon, although I don't know what normal is. This whole mess really has been painful and draining for the both of us. I hope you find a partner that will give you what I know I can't. I am committed and genuinely happy with my partner and it's not fair for either of us to indulge in delusions that we know will only hurt us and that will never happen. Although unrequited is the wrong word to describe us, you need to move on for both our sake. It's hard to be friends with someone who feels the way you do.
