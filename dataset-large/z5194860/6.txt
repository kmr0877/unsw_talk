message: Ok this is getting ridiculous I just overheard 2 chinese guys go " slaya, keep getting those sl*ts". Seriously how are you going to call someone a sl*t while praising your friend for doing the EXACT same thing?? Its 2016 stop with the sl*t shaming or at the very least apply it to both men/women. Jesus.
