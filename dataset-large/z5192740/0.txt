message: To the amazing tutor / lecturer in elec eng. Your radiant brown skin and amazing accent makes me feel like I have a fire inside my thighs. I need you to come and put it out ;) I need you to stimulate my circuits. To flick my switch. To make me yours. Your initials are DM. You know who you are ;)
