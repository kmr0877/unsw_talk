message: To the redheaded asshole in second year mechanical engineering. Im so sick of u ignoring all of my messages and I dont know what to do anymore u know that I basically love u and its the stupidest thing ive ever done. I can give u what u need so stop this moral act, stop denying this and come back to me its just not the same with anyone else. I miss waking up next to u I know its just a shitty college room but it feels like home. ill never give up cus I know deep down u still want me so u keep me around. \n“The biggest coward is a man who awakens a woman’s love with no intention of loving her”\nLove your COFA friend.
