message: To the girl wearing that orange jumper, looking like she just came out of prison, catching the 891 bus at 9.40 on Monday 16th May,\n\nI wish I could have seen that pretty face of yours. Don't know if it was your incognito day, but those shades and that hat were annoying me. Next time wear the orange jumper without covering your face and I'll come say hi.\n\nFrom the Asian guy carrying the Factorie bag
