message: We should establish some sort of code, like asking someone, "Do you have the time?" (Regardless if you obviously have a watch or electronic device) and it could be code for something like, "Are you single/I think you look interesting to talk to you, and talk to you is what i would desperately like to do, is that okay?" If they answer with, "I dont have the time" (even if they have some-time tracking device) then that's a no and if they answer with "Yes, I do have the time - the time is [time]" then you're good! And if there is any confusion or they are just sincerely giving you the time - well then you know where abouts in your day you are and you walk away - you were so brave ;) talking to that hottie ;) asking for the time ;) you animal.
