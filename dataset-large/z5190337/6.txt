message: Hey A,\n\nWe've been friends for a while now. Through each of your "boys" and "phases"  I've stuck by you and in the process fallen in love with you. I love that you think your hilarious, when you sing, and when you stare at me that little bit longer than usual.But I don't think you've noticed because you still try to set me up with your other girls or jokingly ask me why I'm still single - I'm single because I'm waiting for you to notice that it's always been you. \n\nI'll would never hurt you like he did.\n\nYour "go to"
