message: To the really tall girl I saw outside of Matthew's some Wednesday ago (after my lecture around 1pm),\n\nYou are the most beautiful person I've seen at uni, and I've been here for a while. I would have approached you but I was blinded by your beauty and I was afraid I would non-metaphorically fall for you...down the stairs.\n\nAre you free to grab a drink around that time?
