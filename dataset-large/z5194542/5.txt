message: To the guy sitting on the bench at the corner of the quad at lunch today. You were wearing a white shirt and talking to an international student. I slowed down when I saw you. Your smile, your hair, your laugh. You made me blush just by smiling, I wanted to just stop and stare at you. Hope to see you around again ❤️
