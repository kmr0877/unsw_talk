message: To #11691\nAdvice from a fellow same gender lover. Yes, it's completely normal to be attracted to someone of the same gender. If you want to tell her you like her make sure she's not straight. Straight girl crushes are the worst and they will destroy you. Make sure you're comfortable with your own sexuality as well. My advice on whether to tell her or not is if she's dropping hints that she likes you as more as a friend. If she's straight, that'll probably never happen. That's my advice for now, good luck.
