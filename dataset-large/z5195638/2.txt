message: Okay so i saw all the letters on here ages ago about the benji guy from boost, and didnt really know what all the fuss was about. Then he served me the other day and i saw him again doing some arc thing and OMG i know what they mean. You look like so much fun and were so friendly an outgoing. Where are all the guys like you??
