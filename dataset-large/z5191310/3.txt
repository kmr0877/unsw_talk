message: I was on my way to a 9am tutorial on Monday, the skies were pouring and it was gloomy as heck. But once I arrived at the 891 bus stop at Central, behold, the prettiest girl I've ever seen. I forgot all about my exam. \n\nI think you know who I might be, I sat behind you on the bus. Your hair was mesmerising, I really love the two tone look. Also, your eyeliner was on point. When you glanced at me, my heart stopped beating for a second. I'm not the type of guy who gets shaken easily but you did it, you made me unable to stop thinking about you. \n\nI'll be there next week, around the same time. I hope I can say hi this time. I'd offer you coffee but I'd rather skip the formalities. You're welcome to my place and we can watch some movies and have pizza. \n\nTill next time
