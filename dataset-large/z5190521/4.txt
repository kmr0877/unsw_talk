message: To a first year curry guy (you know who you are),\n\nYesterday was your birthday and there was a party at the round house to celebrate it. I was the one who organised this party and bought the cake. I really hope that you loved the party and that you had an enjoyable time. I have a confession to make. I really have a crush on you. I've had it for most of last semester and am wondering if we can be a bit more than just friends. If not, I will not be angry. I'm an understanding person and will happily accept your decision. You are a cute and friendly guy and any girl will be lucky to have a guy like you by their side.
