message: To the boy in my Quant tute, I have always been straight and never thought about boys this way until I saw you. Side-note - do you work at Mum's Advice Pharmacy? Because if you do, that turns me on even more. You seem like the dominant type, always taking charge in every situation. I think I've also seen you at the gym, I like my men sweaty and you are a sweaty man.   I hope we can get in contact so we can potentially work something out that involves sweat and dominance (but not quant or mum's advice).
