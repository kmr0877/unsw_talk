message: To the president of the Pokemon Society,\n\nI love you so much my little Eevee, the one who I choose since it's all up to me. If you ever get into a fight, I'll fly to your side like a great Dragonite. With psychic attacks like the deadly Mewtwo, I'll battle team rocket just to save you. I think of your lips as you used your sweet kiss, and made my heart yours in absolute bliss. You make my Ekans evolve to Arbok, my Metapod hardens, my knees turn to Muk. In my arms, like an Onix, I'll wrap you up tight, then leer at you gently and hope you don't bite. I'll tackle and take down and put you in bed, then chatter and charm you to make your cheeks red. You're sweeter than Horsea, and cuter than Mew. More Graceful than Goldeen, forget Pikachu. I'll capture your Cloyster with my Lickitung, I won't stop until you're Weezing and your top's undone. All through the moonlight until the morning sun, we'll role play and rollout until we are one. Then finally, I'll use future sight my amore, give a peck on the cheeck and whisper encore. Please be my Nidoking.\n\nLove,\nYour adoring pokefan
