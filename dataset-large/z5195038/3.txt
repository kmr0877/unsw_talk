message: Sudheshan from NCV (unsw)\n\nYou're the cutest boy I've ever met, you can't even imagine how cute I think you are. I have had a crush one you ever since I saw you drunk for the first time. You're like this cute little piece of yummy idk what I can't even think straight :( \nI know you like someone else and it breaks my heart day by day, endlessly. Please, get over her. Look for someone else, I'll be the first one which your path will cross with. Stop liking someone while someone else have intense feelings for you. \n\nFrom the girl you met and kissed you on the cheeks in ivy.
