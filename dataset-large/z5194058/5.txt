message: It was 8.35 am, and the final exam was rapidly approaching. I knew where I had to go: Skyline Room, Level 3. I was ready. I headed for the escalators stretching up the side of the Grandstand.\nThat was when I saw the signs. Ballroom. Kensington Room. Grandview Room. Something was wrong. I ducked out of line and turned, confused, searching for an answer. Had I read the directions wrong? Was this even right building?\nThere were eight minutes left and I was at the point of panicking. And then I saw it: the Arc help desk, a beacon of friendly green shining before my sleep-deprived eyes. They could show me the way to Skyline, and all I had to do was ask.\nThank you, Arc, for showing me the love I didn't even know I needed.
