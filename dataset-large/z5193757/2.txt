message: Mr Shmilovits,\n\n1) How I am oh so grateful for Skinner announcing your name in BA to the class, so I knew who to address this post to.\n2) Has anyone ever told you you like kind of like Macklemore (in a good way)?\n3) The fact that you created Uni Study Guides makes you even hotter, generous and all-round amazing.\n4) Please tell me you're single?
