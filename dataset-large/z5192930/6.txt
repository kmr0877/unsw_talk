message: Started having feelings for one of my closest friends of a few years, but Im scared Im in the friend zone. Im still gonna tell her anyways cause hey might as well take a chance, and it's not good to keep things on the inside. Kinda nervous cause I'm scared I'm gonna loose a friendship but its k, wish me luck lads. This one goes out to all mah hommies too shy to tell that girl/guy they like them. Everything's always worth a try, follow ur mf hearts  #ytb
