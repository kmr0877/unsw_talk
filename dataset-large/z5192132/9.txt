message: Dear Henry of #12764\n\nI tried to make a life with you but doors lead to trap doors, a stairway leads to nothing. In the tradition of men in past, you post onto UNSW Love Letters, then lie to me you love me. What are you hiding? I've  tried to change, closed my mouth more, tried to be soft, prettier, less awake. If it’s what you truly want… I can wear her skin over mine, be like this Nadz.\n\n Why do you lie to me, is it because you're an actor in Law Revue? Why do you deny yourself heaven? Why do you consider yourself undeserving? Why are you afraid of love? You think it’s not possible for someone like you. I don’t know when love became elusive. What I know is, no one I know has it. Rest in peace, my true love, you took me for granted. I was the most bomb p*ssy who, because of you, sleep evaded\n\nGood Luck with your side chick at Law Revue. \n\nEmma
