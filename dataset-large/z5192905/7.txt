message: To the cute and smart guy in my comp1927 lecture, I think your friends call you Andrew? But I also heard them call you Foot? \n\nYou make my day every time I see you in what otherwise would be a super boring lecture. Out of all the guys there (like 99% of the lecture theatre), you have caught my attention.\n\nPlease be the one, be the one only, will you be, be the one, be the only one?\nxoxo secret admirer, aka the girl who sits near the mid-left section of the lecture theatre :)
