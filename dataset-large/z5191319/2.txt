message: Dear God,\nIf you want A and I to be together, can you please let me know, so I can decide whether to move on or not, especially since tonight I found out a new fact? Because sometimes I think I see him around, but I can't be sure because it's been so long.. Can you arrange the stars so we bump into each other around our workplaces? That would be amazing! If it's written in the stars. Cheers!\n\nTake a deep breath and jump and fall into me. Don't be afraid to jump, then fall into me. But I'll hold you through the night until you smile.
