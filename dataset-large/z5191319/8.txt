message: Not so much a love letter but, I recently went out with my boyfriend and he pretty much ignored me for the whole night because his friends were around him. This happens every time. I really want to tell him that I'm sick and tired of him not being romantic and spontaneous and making me feel like a piece of shit because I got treated like an absolute goddess in my last relationship (even though we broke up for other reasons). I'm too scared to tell him how i really feel because he was my best friend and I know the mental damage this could do to him since I have dealt with it before. What do I do? Help pls
