message: "If you live for hundred, I wish to live for hundred minus one. So I'll never have to live without you" I sent you that on our last high school Valentine's Day. \n\nDue to culture factors, I can't call out your name. But, you are the most important person to me since high school to now, without you I will not be able to make it this far. Without you I'll not be able to get off my anger management issues. Without you, my life will be a mess.\n\nEven though there will be more obstacles in our future life, but I believe we will be able to tackle it just like all the other downs we experienced together. \n\nNot matter what day, I'll still keep that promise. If you live for hundred, I wish to live for hundred minus one, so I'll never have to live a day without you!\n\nYour Love ðŸ’‹
