message: To the Asian guy who might've been chatting me up while I was waiting for my friend in upper campus food court, \nI'm so sorry that I just walked away. I had no idea, that you were trying to hit me up? Were you? I have no idea. Even if you weren't, coffee some time?\n\nPurple haired brown girl.
