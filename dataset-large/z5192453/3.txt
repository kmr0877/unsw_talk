message: To all those foreveralone people, don't worry. You've only lived a certain proportion of your life and what you have witnessed is only a tiny corner on a piece of paper. There is still time and there are plenty of fish in the sea. Problem is, you won't get anywhere if you post up here anonymously. Although you are doing something but it will seem creepy to some and that doesn't generally work in your favour. Sometimes maybe you don't have to look far, sometimes maybe that person is just right in front of you but your expectations are blinding you =]
