message: To the the one that got away,\n\nMy heartstrings were plucked and resonated deep waves of longing and misery as you sprinted away in all your elegant flurry from me despite our obvious connection. In that brief moment our eyes met, you assumed I was coming towards you to sell a magnificent revue on campus. But my convictions and my purpose to promote was no more than a sham, but to talk to you. To steal a bit of your precious time to say that you were mine, even temporarily. To tell you that everything paled in comparison to your beauty. So please stop and say hello the next time you see me in a pink jumper or a blue T-shirt. Because all I can think of is you. \n\nAwkward Promo Guy
