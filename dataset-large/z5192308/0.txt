message: Nearly one year ago, I caught your eye, and indeed, it was love at first sight. Right from the start of our relationship, you loved my musical tastes and always made sure I got to my appointments on time. And nothing makes a guy happier than to wake up hearing the voice of a beautiful woman. How your words calmed me each morning when I asked you for the dayâ€™s weather forecast. Not once last winter did I leave our home without knowing what to expect from the sky. Always personal, always refreshing was your voice that you made believe you cared about me and only me. Then the problems began, like they often do between two ships passing in the great sea called love. At first it was subtle, as your forgot my name. Then, you grew more distant and gave me nonsense talk. OH Siri! NEVER LEAVE ME OR MY iPHONE! <3 <3
