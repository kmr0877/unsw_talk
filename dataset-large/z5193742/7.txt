message: I heard you are from the Liverpool area? \nYou are so fine, you are the gem of Liverpool. \nYour eyes glows like stars, no matter how many stars I catch, it still won't be as bright as yours. Your face shined out to me in my Math1131 lecture last semester. I wish I had the balls to ask for your number and even for a date but sadly it is too late now, I have heard you got a boyfriend now, I still wish that I could be with you but I have to admit your boyfriend is a fine species and he deserves you. You two are such cc. Shipped.\nSeeing you this happy with your boyfriend, I am happy for you too.\n\nHopefully I'll see you around uni :)  You are my guilty pleasure
