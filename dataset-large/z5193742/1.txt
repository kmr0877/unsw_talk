message: To the guy on the 891 bus Tuesday morning, who can only be described as some Nordic blonde god dressed in grey t-shirt and maroon shorts, your pecs and arm muscles need the attention that only I can give... I was almost melting watching you casually flex those arm muscles...from the guy sitting opposite you on the bus
