message: Just as you walk on by,\nImmediately, you catch my eye.\n\nThe way you look ties me up in knots,\nAnd makes me think a million thoughts:\n\nThrough your skirts and dresses the wind does flow,\nWhile you smile gives off a heavenly glow.\n\nNothing on this earth can fair,\nAgainst your long, smooth, silky hair.\n\nThe way you move makes my heart shake,\nAnd gives my nerves the greatest quake.\n\nYour eyes (when visible) are flecked with colour,\nWhere I lose myself in their sea of wonder.\n\nFloating amidst your deep and gorgeous eyes,\nIt tears me up to have to say our goodbyes.\n\nAs you continue your day along a path thatâ€™s different,\nI will always remember that split-second moment.\n\nWith all these thoughts that ring so true,\nI hope this will eventually find its way to you.
