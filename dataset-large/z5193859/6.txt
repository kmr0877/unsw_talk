message: It's always the same, morning Monday\nDrinking hot chocolates and hot chai lattes\nWe gather around and have our own say\nTalking our hearts out at Ainsworth café\n\nWe do the chem quiz to pass on the day\nLaughing at Bill at his quirky display\nWe look at the questions our minds blank away\nTurning to Emily who rescues the day\n\nWe all comfort Neesha in all her dismay\n"Scott that salty dog" harassing away!\nBut never discouraged and never too grey\nCause Kenneth is love, and Kenneth is Bae!\n\nThere's always that one that's lost in the hay\nYawning, complaining and hungry okay?\nChubby and funny, it's almost cliche \nHere comes Angela, please back away!\n\nI love you guys all, and I will miss these days\nThere's not enough words to fully convey \nI hope to see you in midst of our ways\nLet's have a blast, at Ainsworth café\n\nLove Paul
