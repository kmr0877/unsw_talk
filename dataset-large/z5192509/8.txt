message: To #12738\nSeems like you actually have feelings for the guy that you said you will never like \nI can sense it from the way you talked about him. Seems like you do care about him and that you are afraid of something (regarding your relationship with him)\nTake time and reflect on it gurl. Before it's too late\n\nSincerely,\nA complete stranger with numerous experiences regarding these kind of issues.
