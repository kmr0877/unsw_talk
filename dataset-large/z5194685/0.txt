message: Gustavo Louis G. Montano, I accidentally saw you when I was stalking Alexander Vatiliotis. He is cute, but you and the guy with you in Alexander's cover photo are SO HOT!!!!!!!!!!!!! And I saw that you are good in Math! So since Alexander is cute, the guy with you is oozing hot and you are extremely handsome, can we all have foursome? Oh, and I'm bad at Math. Really bad. please personally punish me. <3
