message: To the cute Sri-Lankan guy in my PHYS1121 and ENGG1000 lectures... i think your name was Sam? You are hotter than any curry i have ever had. The way you play with your pen and stare make my heart melt. Maybe you'd like to have coffee and chill? Preferably with no clothes ðŸ˜‰ Sincerely, a asian girl who's to shy to say hi.
