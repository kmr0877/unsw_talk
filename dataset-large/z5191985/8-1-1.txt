message: After years of research and analysis as an outside source, I was able to develop a weeb to friendship formula, investigating the correlation between the number of anime watched/manga read in one given work day, the number of anime merch owned and the number of anime related forums joined.\n\nBy my calculation and observation, you should have ~negative 345 friends. I'm astounded you are able to function in every day society since you are queen weeb\n\nYou are an embarrassment to the Meng legacy
