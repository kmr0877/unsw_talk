message: To the goregeous asian girl, with the copper hair and weaeing flip-flops, on the 891 express from central this morning (28/05/13), catching you when the bus suddenly stopped turn my fogging morning into a bright sunny one. We then got off at the 2nd stop on high street amd sadly went our seperate ways. I'm probably out of your league but i have to say you are very pretty and the next time i catch you is when you hopefully fall for me :)
