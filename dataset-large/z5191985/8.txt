message: To all those introverted people out there,\nI remember a long time ago commenting to my older sibling how antisocial they were at UNSW and how I'd never met any of their friends. Some months later, I heard a quiet knock and them asking me, "How do you make friends?" I cried that night because I realised how much they wanted to make friends but were too shy to go up to others. \nSo for all those social, extroverted people not afraid to say hi, go up to someone you know always sitting alone or always at the library and drag them with you to eat and to walk and to have fun. Because deep down, even if they're not saying it aloud, they're definitely saying thank you. \nIt's never too late to make friends.\nFrom a thankful introvert.
