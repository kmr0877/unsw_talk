message: To My Dearest Grace Chen,\nYou are the most beautiful girl in my eyes. I get lost in your deep mesmerising chocolatey brown eyes everytime ours eyes meet. Your thin pink lips curve in the slightest way when you greet me. I hide away in embarrassment when you lean towards to listen to me. I have never experienced such a feeling. And as soon as we talked in the first lab lesson. I know you were the one for me. Although you may never reciprocate  my live, just know that when you need a man to lean in I'm there for you. \nYours sincerely,\nThe man who is lost in love with you
