message: To the guy lying on the library lawn around 11.30am today (13th may) wearing an iggy pop tshirt and maroon jeans and listening to music, you are Ryan Gosling's doppelganger ;) I really appreciate your aesthetic appeal, you can be my eye candy any day. Love, the indian girl in the grey stripy tshirt and black jeans in the group on your LHS.
