message: I'm not from UNSW but I served her a drink last year, we exchanged looks then numbers. She invited me for wedges at the white house and laughed at my dreams, but now i dream about her laughter... If see's this i want her to know, even though i leave for Ireland at the end of the semester, she'll always be my voluptuous woman from the seas.
