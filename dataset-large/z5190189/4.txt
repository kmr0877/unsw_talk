message: This is more like an appreciation post but to the girl sitting in front of me on the bus at around 9:15. You were wearing a grey t and blue jeans and you had your brown hair tied up in a bun. I was the girl sitting behind you and I couldn't help but notice how pretty you were when the sun was shining on you. Also good luck with whatever you were studying on the bus~
