message: In response to post #12380, Jason Khou, I want you! If you will let me be your asset,  ease the liability you cause to my heart, it's too hard to manage right now. Can we create equity, because I know that an if have you as an asset and I minus this liability it will equal equity. I will meet you outside your ACTL3182 class at 1pm next Tuesday.
