message: In need of some advice from UNSW's Lovers.\nSo there's this girl we had a FWB type of relationship. But then we became too good of friends and we kind of faded out the sexual component of the relationship. Its been almost 4 months since that happened, need some advice on how to bring that sexual component back in the game.\nYour help shall be highly appreciated.
