message: Hi Joel (S?). A small time ago, I witnessed your carelessly parted curtain of sunshine-weaved hair blown back by the wind to reveal a boyish grin that lit up the path in front of you. Right then, crystal clear eyes, sparkling like the topaz waters of a Mediterranean lagoon, shone over me for the most precious fraction of a second that only you could calculate. As I saw your tender lips and rough jaw moving from afar, my heart knew with inexplicable certainty that you spoke words of cutting wit, yet also with remarkable depth and kindness. My stars, your figure could have been traced by Inoue Takehiko.\n\nBut how jealous I am of the only 3 girls in your course. Even though I know that I am unworthy of your notice, with my dyed brown hair and downcast air. I yearn for the moment when we are properly introduced, and you sweep me off my feet. Sadly. Admiringly. Longingly. In... Vain?\n\nEver waiting for you, from another second year (friend of an acquaintance) to my sweet anime prince.
