message: Dear Stanley Hu,\n\nHu are you to me? You are the man waltzing through my dreams every night, having multiple roots with you through my most complex fantasies. No matter what permutation or combination of you exists, I know I would manage to pick you every time. You cis-tematically calculated the path to my heart through your looks and personality. \n\nYou and me are the two lines of an absolute value that converge together, fated to be with each other.\n\nHSP sometime? \n\nYour secret lover xx
