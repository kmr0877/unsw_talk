message: The first time we talked was over a year ago now. Everyone else had gone out for pizza, so we just sat and talked and drank those expired cans of cider. Over the next few months I realised that I really liked you, but I was too terrified of rejection to say anything unless I knew you felt the same way. So I hung around, and in retrospect probably acted a little bit creepy around you as I tried to figure out a way to bring it up. I couldn't tell if the signals you were giving off were just me imagining it because I wanted it to be true, or if they were obvious enough that even someone like me could notice them.\n\nEventually the end of the year came around and I decided I must have imagined the whole thing, so I should just drop it, and get over you. At least we could still be friends, right? Turns out it's not really that easy, and apparently you don't even want to talk to me any more. It's now been almost a year since we said more than a few words to each other, and I have no idea if you're going to read this, or if you're even going to realise it's about you, but I'd still like to talk. Send me a message.
