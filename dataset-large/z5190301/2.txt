message: Lost Mobile Phone: Can you please help me find my mobile phone? I accidentally left it behind on the table outside CLB 7. It's a black Samsung Galaxy Ace in a black leather casing and it has a bat as a keychain. The lockscreen image is a Tardis. Apparently a guy picked it up somewhere between 11:15 and 11:30am on the 9th October. If this guy is you, could you please return it to me? If anyone could help me find it that would be much appreciated because I really need it for work and picking up my younger sister. Any details please inbox me or send an email to chs_lorikeet@hotmail.com
