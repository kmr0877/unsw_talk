message: I often use these forms just to vent my feels, because the person I'd like to talk to is never available (this is about Evan again). I don't even particularly want to talk about my feelings to him directly, it's more that the negative ones wouldn't exist so often if I could just see him more, and when I do see him they tend to go away. We don't even have to do anything, seriously, I'll be happy to just study together - especially since that would encourage me to actually study.
