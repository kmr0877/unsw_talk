message: To the tall, shaved headed man wearing a cap, white shirt and black boots and pants today (Monday the 3rd of June), you have the most piercing blue eyes i have ever seen. You saw me in the stock-market line, in the library, and at the library lawn. I can't believe i'm doing this but I'm deferring next semester and don't think i'll ever see you again, but if you read this, on the off chance you see me, please say hello. Kicking myself for watching you walk away today. Love, the girl with long brown hair who is pretty much always looking back. ps. Admin you have to post this, this has been going on for three years!
