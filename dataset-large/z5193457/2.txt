message: To Edward Quo/Kwo/Kuo,\n\nSoz for butchering your last name, I'm too focused on your handsome face and impressive gains. You're constantly surrounded by girls which makes me really intimidated *cries* and even tho I'm a shy, meek girl, I hope you take the time to venture outside your tight knit circle of fuccgurls and look my way. \n\nSincerely and lots of love,\nS.J. xx
