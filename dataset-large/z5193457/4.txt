message: To the guy I first spotted walking out of UNSW Village today (Wednesday 17th of August at about 12:20), we walked together for a while and then split up, only to meet again on Anzac Parade. We made eye contact a couple of times and at the Barker Street crossing I removed my earphones in the hopes that you would talk to me. I then carried on straight and you crossed the road again. You're beautiful. I wish I had talked to you! Coffee sometime?
