message: You have light caramel hair, laced with warm hints of honey. I could tell you surfed from your wind swept hair. I tried to approach you but you were always surrounded by your other friends. I think I was too shy. All I could think the whole time was;\n"WTF how is anyone that good looking?" You sit up the back, I sit at the front. Some people call it Chinatown; It's the only place I can see properly so I can't help it. I wish you saw what I saw. Are you single 1st year BCMP student?
