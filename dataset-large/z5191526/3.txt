message: To the cute boy in my Monday morning MATH1131 lecture. I've had my eyes on you all semester, I think i've heard someone call you 'Matt' or some people 'Haye'. Anyway, I love how a good looking guy like you is also smart enough to do engineering too. Please comment on the post if you'd like to meet up.
