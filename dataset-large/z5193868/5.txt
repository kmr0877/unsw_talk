message: To the Egyptian God of Love, Abishai Phillip, and his less appealing but still hot af sidekick Jey Thiru, im Chinese and not usually into brown ppl but you guys are honestly are a couple of good looking curry dudes. Its hard to ignore those sculpted jawlines and luscious oak blended pupils, those masculine stubbles and those toned biceps. if u guys could take some consideration for the shy girls that find u attractive and try to avoid being seen in public with your hot female social group, it might make us feel more confident to approach you guys and put our numbers in your phones. I occasionally see you guys munching on some hsps at quad foodcourt while i just sit there with my friends and admire from a distance, wishing it was my tongue into your  mouths rather than the meat and chips. \n\nHopefully we can eat hsps together soon!!!! and if you guys still wanna eat well.... you know what im implying ;)
