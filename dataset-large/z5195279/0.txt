message: Dear you; you probably don't know who you are, but man, you just casually stepped on my heart and kept walking. I was going to ask you out for coffee, and we could have watched game of thrones and adventure time, and then had wildly insane sex! In my head it all worked out perfectly; I could bake you macarons, and cakes, and cookies, and cupcakes, and we could go clubbing and look for another girl for threesomes, because I'm totally in to that, and I would have rocked up on your doorstep in nothing but vintage lingerie under a trenchcoat some time... But now that won't happen, and it makes me so sad.
