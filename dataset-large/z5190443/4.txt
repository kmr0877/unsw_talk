message: Honestly, Social Soccer used to be so much more organised and fun when Nick was in charge. Most importantly he was soooooo much hotter than the lot running the joint now. I'd jump on that any day of the week. Why did you have to go Nick? We loved you so much more. \n\nAlso ditch the girlfriend and I'll show you what it really means to have a fun time ;)\nxoxoxo Your Secret Admirer.
