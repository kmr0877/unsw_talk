message: Why can't you want me like the other girls do? They stare at me while I stare at you Why can't I keep you safe as my own? One moment I have you the next you are gone Rehearsed steps on an empty stage That girl's got my heart in a silver cage Why can't you want me like the other girls do? They stare at me while I crave you â™¥
