message: To the gorgeous Asian girl sitting by herself in the library on level four. I can tell you're not actually studying from all the random bursts of laughter I can hear and your cute black glasses perched on the tip of your nose are fooling everyone but me. Your husky voice speaks pure sex to me. You are stunning. I hope our paths cross sometime in the future. - T.J.
