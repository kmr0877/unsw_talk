message: Dear ex, \n\nI appreciate your sincerity. It's all a bit bittersweet isn't it? When you realise what you had only when it's gone. To hear you say what you said, was also bittersweet. Sweet because it was everything I wanted to hear. And bitter because it came all too late. \n\nIt's not that I'm still angry, its not that I want you suffer like I did. It's just that I'm not who I was anymore. I can't hold on to what we had like I did before, I can't look at you and tell myself you do care, you're just stressed, you're just busy, I just need to give you time and space. I can't do it. People adapt you know, people evolve. And I've learnt too much about loving myself that I can't love you just the same anymore. \n\nI'm glad you've learnt. We can still be friends. I want to see you happy too. Maybe you'll meet a girl one day who'll make you want to give your all even if you do end up in pieces too. Maybe then you'll remember us and not hold back again. It's funny how different people have different meanings in our lives. If my pain and our misfortune was all for you to learn this lesson, I'm happy to have been that girl. I wish you well. x
