message: Dear Kyung Lee,\nI have a confession to make and I wanted to do this before we graduate. So here is my confession "I love thee to the depth and breadth and heigh my soul can reach, when feeling out of sight for the ends of being and ideal grace. I love thee to the level of everyday's most quite need, by sun and candle-light". Will you complete my soul?
