message: Dear Alberto Motta,\n\nFor the past 13 weeks I have grown a liking to you, your jokes, your hair and your accent. The amount of hours i've put into economics to make you proud and notice me was not worth what you've just put me through. The final exam was a complete deal breaker for us now, and the fact that you started a relationship with NONE OF THE ABOVE to completely ruin my chances of passing made my attraction to you diminish even more. You promised me the exam would be similar to the textbook, nothing outside of the textbook, you've probably said this to all the other students you've lead on just like me though.\nP.S. You can do better, I hope NONE OF THE ABOVE dies in the long run to save the future students.
