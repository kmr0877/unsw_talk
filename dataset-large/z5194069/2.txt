message: Three years later and still loving on Matthew Lewis. \n\nBeautiful Moobert. \n\nI wish the world was made of people just like you. And when I get married I hope its to someone just like you. \n\nAnd when I have a son, I hope he's someone just like you.\n\nYou're my favourite person in the whole world even after three years.       \n\nYou're the most special Moo in the whole world and I know that secretly everyone must be in love with you. Because I just can't understand how they could not.
