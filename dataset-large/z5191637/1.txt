message: Lucy Xu, \nSeeing your dyed beautiful flowing hair and casual 'girl next door' dress sense is so refreshing to all the other fake plastic girls at unsw. Makes me look forward to every week Thursday when you're in my class ;) I sometimes see you around with another guy at uni, is that your bf? Ditch him, I'm hotter and smarter ;) coffee sometime?
