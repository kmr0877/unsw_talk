message: Yash, others may not appreciate your abrasiveness but I do. I need a man like you to hold me tight at night when my Criminal Laws readings are just too confronting. To teach me to look after my body the way you do. I can't help but 'mire' your Zyzz-esque 'aesthetics', and was told specifically that I couldn't make a move on them during camp. Damn it was hard to resist, but I made it through, but there's this one person that I can't get off my mind ever since camp. I don't want to mention names, but girls if you thought your leader was a cute hunk, message him on Facebook. :)
