message: To the Asian boy that stands out, I met you at shark hotel, you were like an Asian James Bond but I heard you call me a Munter :( after stalking your FB and finding out you go to unsw I had to tell you that I still think you're a diamond in the rough and I'd like to put my own gel in your hair and let you feast on my quokka. Heehee, your secret admirer xo
