message: Dear Claris\nI sat next to you in a comp lecture once, you were really worried about how good you are at coding and told me how you bought your specific glasses to be like Clark Kent. I haven't spoken to you since but I see you around campus. I really liked you from that first encounter. I love nothing more than to hold you and show you how beautiful you are :) physically you are a goddess, you have the most gorgeous smile and perfect features, and the most perfect personality in my opinion, all i want to do is make you mine :) if you're still struggling with coding I'd love to help you out :)
