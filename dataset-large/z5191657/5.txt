message: To Allan Oh/Hoe/Ou?\n\nI'm actually a pretty shy and awkward girl. I guess you could call me that but my friends suggest that I use my common sense and perpetuate away from that notion.\n\nAnyway, i just wanted to say that you're hella cute especially when you wear a scarf since it makes you look like you're more sophisticated. Next time we bump into eachother, say hi instead of grimacing at me and looking down at your phone again to post more memes/play more facebook basketball. Now my friends think that I'll be single for life thanks to you but in reality, we'll probably end up having babies.\n\nAnyways, that's it. I'll come say hi to you, my little sweet pork bun (Allan).\n\nTil whenever~,\n\nMs Bokky
