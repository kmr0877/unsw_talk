message: To Sam Pearson, the recent PhD graduate in CAMD, I never had a chance to tell you- since having you as a lab demonstrator, I had THE biggest crush on you. I wish I was a little smarter so I could have maintained longer intellectual conversations when I timed it right and snuck into the same lift! (Ok that sounds a bit creepy. Let's just leave it as "I'm your biggest fan") -Anonymous
