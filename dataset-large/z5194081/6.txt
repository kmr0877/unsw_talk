message: I always sit next to this short midgety girl called rnp rebella at the Quad computer labs. We study together, play league of legends together (I have baby sit her on the bot lanewhen she plays ashe) and every week eat dinner together. But I think its time that I express myself. If this post gets over 200 likes I will sing a song to my dear rebella at Quad computer lab 2 at 4pm next Thursday. The song will be Hey soul sister. :) see ya guys there.
