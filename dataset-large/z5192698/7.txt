message: It all started with that pair of blue eyes,\nBlue just like the ocean view from Qantas above,\nMy heart skipped a beat gazing at her dazzling blue skies,\nThough the mouth uttered no words those blue orbs cannot tell lies.\nWhen mine eyes landed on Em. Morrison, her silky blonde hair, along with the tad bit curves,\nmethought she purged the air of pestilence,\nO, Those eyes of crystal blue entice me leading me astray,\nIf ever those blue spheres call on me I can't help but obey,\nThe waking hours pleasures me to see the blues on display,\nThe shut at night and I can't wait until the break of day,\nI will follow those blue eye's never needing reason's why,\nFor there's a feeling that I need only she can supply,\nAnd though they make me weak I pray those blue eye's always stay.
