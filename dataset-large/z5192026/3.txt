message: Hey, why do you have to seenzone me all the time? Do you know how much it hurts? Every time my phone lights up I hope it's you. Sometimes I wait for hours for a notification. Even when it is you, it's just one word replies. Every time I ask you out, you just make up random excuses. You won't even give me a chance. Lately, I've been asking you questions about school work hoping you will talk to me, but yet you still don't. I know you are avoiding me because I have a girlfriend but the one I like is you, and I just to be with you.
