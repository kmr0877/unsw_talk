message: To the girl in the blue and white shirt with glasses in the science quad,\n\nI met you today and oh what a day. Not only are you literally the cutest Indian I have ever seen, but you told me where to get free pancakes and hot chocolate. \n\nYour hot and you come with free food, I'm bloody dead.
