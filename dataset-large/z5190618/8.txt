message: Omg Wahaaj Rana you're hat makes me wetter then an umbrella on a rainy day. Tbh your beard has been an international sex symbol ever since first sem and I have been following your escapades very closely. You are the reason I'm still at unsw and would put up with tri-mesters as long as you're face is around me <3 You know who I am, we share this unwavering connection that nobody can deny.  Don't be afraid to say hi next to our eyes lock in our Tutorial.\n\nYour secret admirer <3
