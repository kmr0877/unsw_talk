message: There is a guy - possibly a lecturer or staff member or PhD student - that walks barefoot and with shorts along the 3rd floor corridor. I don't know your name, but I love how you give a shit about formalities. I wish I knew your name and I'd run barefoot to your office to show you I'm as cool as you are.
