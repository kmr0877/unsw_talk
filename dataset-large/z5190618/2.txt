message: To my crush in UNSW. You make me scared of sleeping, because you always appear in all my dreams. I like you a lot but I don't want to like you anymore. You're no longer available and the idea of liking someone that will never ever going to be mine hurts me so badly :'( I don't want to be hurt.... I wish I knew you before her, so that you would be mine. But would you be mine if you didn't meet her? Anyway, I believe that you're not good enough for me and that's why things turn out to be this way, and maybe I deserve someone better....
