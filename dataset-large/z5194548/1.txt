To the girl who took LEGT1710 lecture last semester on Tuesday 4-6pm in law building, frequently sitting in the middle section and first row of seats...Having class at Quad at 5pm on Wednesday...I was telling my friend I saw the most beautiful girl ever on Wednesday at 5pm and there you were walking past me. I got so excited I was speechless. I don't know your name, neither did I had the gut to ask but you have nice long brown hair and Nike shoe =]. I hope to know who you're...
