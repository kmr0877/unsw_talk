message: if there isn't such a thing there should be, would be cool to chat about what is happening with rebirth in dc, is it ozymandians who intercepted doomsday when he was sent to the phantm zone, is ozymandians the good or bad guy, will superman ever be accepted by the league or wil he always be a painful reminder of supermans death. this needs to be a thing.
