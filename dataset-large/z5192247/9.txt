message: Dear my beloved Anna Dang\nSince week 1 I've been swept off my feet by your unspeakable beauty. I have admired your glittering eyes and faultless curves. You tend to hang with some other boys so I'm unsure whether you're in a relationship or not. If you aren't I'd love to share a drink with you at the Whitehouse. Everyday your presence and the sight of you makes me love my life more day by day. Secret Admirer
