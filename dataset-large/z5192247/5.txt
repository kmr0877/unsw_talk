message: to all the genuine people who havent gotten a love letter, i love you.\n\nlol its so funny reading these love letters about people overly complimenting people- "omg to the cute guy yadah yadah yadah" and then seeing their friends tag them, clicking on their profile and discovering that these people clearly wrote these messages about themselves. They genuinely think they are fooling people hahahahahahahahahaha\n\ngive me a break
