message: To the girl sitting outside Tyree wearing a black top at around 11:30. I was the guy in the white top, having coffee with some friends. You were with a guy and girl. We made eye contact, but you vanished down the walkway with them before I got a chance to come talk to you.\n\nLet's meet for a coffee.
