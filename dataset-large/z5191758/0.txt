message: To David Bright, lecturer from CRIM 3001. I'm thankful that you've made lecture attendance compulsory because that brings all the hot boys to the yard! Each week I can be happily distracted by the winning smiles, athleticism and insightful contributions of such peers as we meander through theory after theory. Yours truly, BA (Criminology) dude :)
