message: The world needs more love. In times of need, we all need that pick me up to tell us that not all is lost and there is a light at the end of the tunnel. I will be writing love letters to strangers and hiding them all around campus. With all the love going around here, I hope some of you will join me in making someone smile and UNSW a better place.
