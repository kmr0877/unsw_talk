message: Hey OP - Send them an email and detail your experience - so that they can take your experience into consideration \n\nhttps://www.campusbiblestudy.org/about/contact\n\nI haven't used that form before, but I think if you wanted to use it anonymously you could just put a "bob@theinternet.yeah" type thing in the form would let you - but I'm sure they'd also love to be able to reply to you as well.\n\nEdited: My badly phrased (and, actually, quite rude, my deepest apologies) original comment - was badly - suggesting that the fact that UNSW is a public university is why it's okay for these things to take place - however your experience shouldn't have. \n\nTo others who may be approached; if you're not interested, let them know - if they continue, then shoot campus bible study an email as well. They can't do anything about it if they don't know it's happening.
