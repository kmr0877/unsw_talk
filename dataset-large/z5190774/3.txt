message: To the "Bible Study" people - thanks for the lovely missionaries you send around campus who politely ask what you think of Christianity only to harass you thereafter and try to argue with you when you don't take the same view as them. I may have sat there and listened politely and smiled, but you ruined my day. A public university, particularly in this day and age, is no place to force your small-mindedness on others. You're a disgrace.
