message: To the sexy greek boy that studies mechanical engineering. You looked so hot in those red pants you wore the other day with that denim shirt with the hoodie. You know who I am, we say hi every now n then, and I wish you would ask me how my day was. No matter, I just want you to know that I dream about you all the time and you are who I think about when I touch myself. You are the reason I went to the cruise last night and every time I tried dancing with you, you didn't even notice me. It's ok, I know that one day we'll have our chance together.
