message: To that cute first year engineering student wearing the Tommy Hilfiger shirt and sweatpants in my PHYS1131 lecture on Monday morning. I like the way you look when you doze off, your luscious lips and mesmerizing gaze. The mere presence of you sends shivers down my spine, making me so turned on <3. Not only does your chiseled body make my senses tingle, your contagious laugh never fails to bring a smile to my day. If you were mine our bodies touching could be like a galaxy exploding into a million pieces, creating a whole new world, molding together as one on the soft surface of your mattress, a cloud of ecstasy in the darkness, our hearts finally falling together like rain.
