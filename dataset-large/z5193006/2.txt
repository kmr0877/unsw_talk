message: To the cute boy with nerdy Ray Ban glasses and wavy hair in my FINS3641 lecture, I saw you in my first lecture, but you never turned up after that. I hope to see you again because the way you intently listen in the lecture taking handwritten notes motivates me to pass this course! I hope to see you again! <3\n#shygirlsittingbehindyou
