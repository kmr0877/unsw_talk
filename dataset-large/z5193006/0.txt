message: To the rugged JD guy with the chops, I think he's the sports guy for LawSoc... I see you walking around the law building like all the time, but I never have the courage to talk to you. I really want to join the Law girls touch team just so I can come see you this Sat at the Law v Med Rugby. If you score a try you might score something else ;)
