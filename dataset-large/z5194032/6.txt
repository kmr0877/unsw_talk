message: To my amazing microeconomics tutor, You're so cute. Everyone in our class loves you, especially when you say stuff like, "sowwy" and "don't wowwy guys". I think I melt a little every time you do that. Your shyness is adorable. It's sort of amusing that you can't make eye contact with anyone in class. Never change :')
