message: Dear Matthew Qian,\nI've seen you at a lot of parties and I sort of have a crush on you. I've been wanting to talk to you but you're always around so many girls better than me. I love everything about you. Your personality, biceps, everything. Hoping something happens between us when we meet ðŸ˜…
