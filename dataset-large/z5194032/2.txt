message: To the beautiful 4th year biomedical engineering student that went to the AGSM building to have a coffee break today, I interrupted your newspaper reading to chat with you but I forgot to ask for your number at the end due to being distracted by your brilliant smile. FML. Come have coffee at AGSM again?
