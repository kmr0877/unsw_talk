message: Dear David Sung,\n\nEver since I first laid eyes on you, my heart throbbed so badly i thought I was having a heart attack at the sweet age of 18. Now two years later, you still haven't noticed me.\n\nI'm considering transferring to UWS now since UNSW is no longer a place I want to be in anymore. Please, if anyone knows why he ignores me, I'll gladly listen with both ears.\n\nYours sincerely.\n\nMike
