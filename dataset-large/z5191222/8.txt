message: Hey Aish,\n\nYou're easily the cutest, sassiest girl in my accounting tute, and it takes a lot to stop myself from staring at you in class.\nDo you go for younger men? I mean I know you're 21 because I stalked you on FB and your profile pic is the only thing I can actually see. Please lessen your security measures in the future so that I can get to know you a little more ;)\n\nMr Blown-away
