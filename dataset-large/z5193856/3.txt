message: Dear Anna Dang, you are the most beautiful girl i've ever seen, I heard you do actuary? Well I do too. You are always sitting with your friends so it's really hard for me to come up to you and say hi, but your brown hair and beautiful smile lights me up inside. I was wondering if we could get coffee sometime?
