message: To the 3rd year comm/law guy who used to be the President of the Management Society. I heard you're going to study at Oxford next semester? I've had a crush on you and your rock hard abs for a while now. Please take me with you next sem, I'll give you a taste of 'down under' so you won't miss home too much ;) xoxo - J
