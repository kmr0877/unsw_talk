message: Last night, by chance I saw this really cute asian girl in a red/maroon ish turtleneck and dark blue jeans eating out with a group of friends at Pancakes on the Rocks in Beverly Hills. I didn't get the chance to get your number- I've been kicking myself ever since, meet up with me?\n-Thatasianguy
