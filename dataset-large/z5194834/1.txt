message: Dear green shirt guy at unsw gym. You caught my eye at 9:37pm on a lonely tuesday evening (7th of may, 2013). As i walked past, i couldnt help but stop and stare at your pure masculine appeal. You picked up that weight as if it was a little feather. Lucky weight, i wish i had your hands all over me. I had to walk back and pretend to sign up to the gym so i could steal another glance. We should catch up sometime xoxo. Btw I'll be joining the gym tomorrow look out for me while you sweat. I have long dark hair with a bit of curls heheheheheh.
