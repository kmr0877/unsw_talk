message: I always see you on the library lawn playfully hanging out with your mates, your long thin legs arouse a sensation within in me that keeps me coming back to the library lawn for more. Your white, wispy hair blows in the wind and your scent makes my nose tingle. When you playfully steal my food I giggle with delight. I can only imagine what that long beak would do to me. The breadth of your wing span never ceases to amaze me, you truly are an incredible gal. Tomorrow Ill be at the library lawn waiting for you, meet me at 12 and then Ill know we have a future. You're the one for me ibis.
