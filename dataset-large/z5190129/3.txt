message: Dear Foundation Day,\n\nYou need to know how I feel, I miss you. Our Mexican Fling last August still holds a very special place in my heart. But I need more, I need to see you again, I need you. I know you are turning 64 but age will be no barrier for our sweet, passionate, intoxicated love. I also realise I cheated on you with october fest and for this I am deeply sorry, I know this year will be different (dammmmmm), you are my one and only. Meet me at the Village Green 7:00AM for "9 before 9" on what will be a sexy magical rainbow filled romantic foundation day epic.\n\nLove Rainbow Firetruck
