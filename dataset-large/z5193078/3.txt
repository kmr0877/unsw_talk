message: Smoking hot brunette manning the Foundation Day Stand,\nAs I was walking out of the library after a long morning of reading, I saw your face. This stopped me in my tracks. How can anyone have such an erotically appealing face and body. I even decided to buy a Foundation Day ticket tonight, so I can have one last feast of eye-gasm before you become lost in the crowd that is UNSW. If I do find you around our immensely large campus ever again, I will introduce myself and hope my feelings have been reciprocated.
