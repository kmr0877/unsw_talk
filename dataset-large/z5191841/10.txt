message: The guy who was sitting directly across from me on Level 6 Main Library on Monday 1pm is pretty cute. He just slid his laptop closer to the centre of the table so he's kinda leaning on his forearms and its making his muscles bulge a lil. Thanks for providing the eye candy on the day I have a MGMT1101 exam. Much appreciate
