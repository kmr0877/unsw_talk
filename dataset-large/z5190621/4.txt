message: To the girl with the beautiful short black hair. The first time i saw you was during the econ1101 lecture, with your constant giggling and obsession with llamas and I have fallen in love with you.\n\nAlas, there seems to be another admirer in the Wei! I remember that happy look on your face when you told him to shoe shoe! \n\nYou have laced my xius with so much love that I have been tripping over the thought of your beautiful black hair. If only you loved me as much as you love shoes ðŸ˜¢ðŸ˜¢.\n\nI have constantly dreamt about putting on some beautiful glass xius on your feet and touching those pure, white, angel-like ankles of yours. You are my one and only sole mate.\n\nLettuce go on a picnic date together, alpaca lunch <3\n\nExcuse me i need t- *ahXIU!!*
