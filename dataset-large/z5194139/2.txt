message: Dear Nick Chee of first year med,\nYour beautiful biceps inspire me to wake up every day and go to another Ken Ashwell lecture. I want to practice anatomy on your biceps brachi (and other muscles 😏) - baby you're better than any cadaver could be. You must be digitalis toxin because my heart pumps extra hard around you. Study the anatomy of the pelvis with me? \n\nEvery girl in first year med xx
