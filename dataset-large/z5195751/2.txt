message: For my Tom Munroe. \nU light up my maths tutorial like a solar panel lights up an energy efficient home. Chances are, you haven't noticed me yet, but rest assured your tangled hair has me obsessed. Kinda wishing I can run my fingers through those tussles right now. Underneath the persona of this quiet and shy engineering student lies a sexually frustrated beast, waiting to be unleashed. The way you those cute little boots gets me all hot and bothered. Others tell me you swing both ways. May these rumours be true so we can be together at last.\nxx
