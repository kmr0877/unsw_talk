message: to the cute guy with glasses in my landscape arch class, (jia.... wang?), i truly hope you're gay. You touched my back one time accidentally, and a little flower bloomed in the pit of my stomach, and i can't get you out of my mind. i perused over your drawings and i remember each and every one of them. i'm not even sure why but i guess i find some semblance of meaning in them, like this imprint is the closest connection to you as a person,  besides that one touch. i wish we could get closer.
