message: I recently found out that the girl (ex-unsw) I've had a huge crush on has a boyfriend. I honestly thought we had great chemistry and our conversations were something that I looked forward to despite running into her once or twice a week. \n\nIt feels so morally wrong to hit on a girl who is already in a relationship (I wouldn't want it to happen to me if the roles were reversed), but on the other hand, it isn't very often that I come across someone who I am genuinely attracted to and feel some magic with.  \n\nDo I simply just let her go? Or will I one day think back and ask myself what might have happened if I did things differently?
