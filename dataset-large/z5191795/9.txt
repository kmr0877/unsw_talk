message: To the scrawny white boy from TKC, I think you do commerce or accounting? I see you around the dining hall and I just can't control my juices. You may not be able to lift me up but damn my heart craves you. I see you walking around in your golf gear and tbh everyone else thinks it's unattractive, but I think you look so sexy. I promise with me you'll get a hole in one. You won't need your glasses to see how love is meant to be. Love from, anon. ‚ù§
