message: Hey cute guy from VSA, I think your name was Peter??? I think you were in YS as well, I saw you at the interview! You had a really cute smile no wonder you got in ;)\n\nSometimes I see you around Bankstown as well, I remember you were going to Crunch, working out those abs aye? We should go work out together sometime, I do cardio, but we can do some strength together <3\n\nI wish you were the pork in my roll~
