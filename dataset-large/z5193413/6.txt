message: To that curry girl who stay in UNSW Village Tower 8:\n\nI have always found you simply so adorable; how your eyes twinkle as you excitedly chat with your other curry housemates in the lobby; how your voice animatedly reverberates within the confines of the otherwise pin-drop silent lift; how heartily you laughed when one of your companions cracked a joke. I have seen you around on numerous occasions, yet I have only been in close proximity with you once: when you flashed me a shy smile with a quick “thanks” after I held the door for you. Sometimes, I can hear your sweet voice echoing chirpily into the silence of the otherwise lonely night, as I imagined how life would be if I were able to lie in your sweet embrace. I honestly hope that I can sum up the courage to pursue my happiness and talk to you, but I am sure that I would freeze up in the divine presence of an angel.\n\nThe socially-awkward curry lad living 3 levels above you\n-hope you don’t find me creepy for knowing where you live though-
