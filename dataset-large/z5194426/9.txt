message: To the korean boy who was with a chinese friend on 17/5. I asked if I can borrow a phone cable off you but you said you didn't have one. I actually didn't really need that phone cable but just wanted to come to talk to you. I later overheard and think your name was Andrew Seo? If you are interested in 'lending' me the phone cable, lets meet up again same time same place everyday until we see each other again. <3 ^^
