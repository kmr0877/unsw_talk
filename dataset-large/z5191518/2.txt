message: So, right from when I first met you I fell for you. Then I got to know you and the feelings only developed more and more. Now as we spend more time together I find myself wishing that there could be more... with the knowledge that nothing could ever happen. I guess I'm preparing myself for years of friendship... I'm not saying anything to you in the hope that our friendship can remain strong, that we can always be together to help each other out and that you will therefore always be in my life... Selfish of me? Selfless of me? If I can hold myself together then we can be together in one way or another...
