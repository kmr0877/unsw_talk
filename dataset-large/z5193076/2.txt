message: To the guy working at Stock Market who gave me soup on Friday,\n\nI was the girl smiling at you like an idiot. Then I wanted to leave without my card. I lost it anyway on the bus.\n\nThank you for the chicken soup. If you don't already have a girlfriend....coffee some time? Just tell me when you have a break.\n\nAnon
