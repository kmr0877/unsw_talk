message: To the guy with yellow-fettish. I beg you, stop creeping on me, i know you've been stalking my albums and have expressed your jealousy to some of our mutual friends. I admit that I have a tendency to take photos with literally any guy that asks to (like literally on the street), but my ego still tells me to filter out some, especially u. You're a GOD at tennis, expertise in food related stuff and timid at times. POP UP and do more stuff with me than just chuckin a selfie like I always do with any other guys.\n\nLet's make onigiri <3
