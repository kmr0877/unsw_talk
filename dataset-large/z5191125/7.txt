message: To the girl who stole my heart and havent returned it since the day we met,\n\nJessica Zhang I know this forbidden  love will never blossom. I just want to get this feeling off my heavy heart. I will forever remember the day you walked by me, asking another guy for directions. I was intriged by the smell of your shampoo as your hair whisked softly in the wind. I accidently overheard your classroom as I realised that we were in the same class together. I was so happy  I would have a chance to meet such a beautiful girl. Until I realised you have a boyfriend. Although I wanted to keep this heavy feeling to myself, I had to let it out. I don't not want to burden you with my confession, therefore I wish you the best in your relationship. Just remember I will always be there for you. \nFrom a guy in your business class
