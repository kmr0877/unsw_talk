message: To the short Asian girl at the matsoc/ceus cruise at the front of the boat with your mates. I think you were in a black dress and studying aviation (or you were talking about planes)? You are quite beautiful and intelligent, and I'm kicking myself for not having a chat with you as I got dragged in by my mates to dance.\n\nCoffee? :)
