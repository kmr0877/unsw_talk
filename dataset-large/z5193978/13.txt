message: It was a wonderful Monday afternoon with the wind blowing through the crests in your pink attire. The moment I laid my eyes on you I heard an explosion. A moment later my friends told me it was my ovaries that exploded because the contrast between your black hair, your brown face and your sluggy pink shirt and pants took my breath away. I don't even know what to thing. I don't know if you're doing it for the breast cancer patients or as a style statement but you have my heart, you have the rest of me, any time any place you want. \n\nP.S. You'll be my pink panther from now on, caress me with your long whiskers or just caress me with that one big thing you've got hiding under all that sultry pink\n\n~~with love\nThe pink lover <3 ... ;)
