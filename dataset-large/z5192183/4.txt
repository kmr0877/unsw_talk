message: Saroop Philip\n\nHow would I love to do un-Christian things with you Saroop. Your chocolate skin reminds me of the finest Lindt and those glasses twinkle like the distant hope of our romance. I love the silky smoothness of your voice, your gentle humour and hopefully, your gentle touch. \n\nBut seriously, coffee sometime? xoxo\n\nRegards, \nHer Moistness
