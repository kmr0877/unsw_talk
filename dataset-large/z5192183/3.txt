message: To the handsome future father of my children, you were walking down the stairs into the quad today (tuesday 24 sept) in your long sleeved gym clothes at about 4pm. My friend and I (blonde asian) walked past you, i was the brunette one on the left in jeans. You were pretty cute, but i go usyd, so if we could just get past this university rivalry, I really think we could make it work. xoxoxo usyd girl
