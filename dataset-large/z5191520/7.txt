message: Madi Moar, you make me weak at the knees. Trying to stop myself saying something stupid and revealing that I have the most massive, embarrassing, year 2-style crush on you is such hard work. Every time I think I'm getting past this I see your amazing full lips or killer style or cute concentration frown and I just melt. If nothing else thanks for showing me that I don't have a straight bone in my body.
